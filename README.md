<h1 align="center" id="title">Intelligent Height Estimation System using ArUco Markers and Machine Learning</h1>

<p id="description"> <strong>Overview</strong>: This repository contains code and a dataset for an Intelligent Height Estimation System using ArUco Markers and Machine Learning. The system leverages linear regression and polynomial features to estimate a person's height based on wrist-to-elbow and ankle-to-elbow measurements.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   1\. Height Estimation - Utilizes linear regression and machine learning to estimate a person's height based on wrist-to-elbow and ankle-to-elbow measurements.
*   2\. Data Analysis - Leverages scikit-learn NumPy and Pandas for efficient data analysis and modeling.
*   3\. Polynomial Features - Employs polynomial features to enhance the accuracy of height estimation.
*   4\. Easy-to-Use - Simple interface for users to input measurements and obtain height predictions.
*   5\. Modular Code - Well-organized modular code that is easy to understand modify and extend.
*   6\. The dataset available in the output\_dataset.csv file consists of anonymized measurements: Wrist\_to\_Elbow Ankle\_to\_Elbow Height
